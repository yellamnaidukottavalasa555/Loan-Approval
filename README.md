# Loan-Approval

Implementation of the Back-Propagation algorithm, made as project for the combinatorial decision making and optimization course's second module taught by Vittorio Maniezzo

Banking Organization deals in all loans. They have presence across all types of Loans. Customer first apply for loan after that bank validates the customer eligibility for loan. Bank wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.

The machine learning model is trained using the training data set. Every new applicant details filled at the time of application form acts as a test data set. On the basis of the training data sets, the model will predict whether a loan would be approved or not.
